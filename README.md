# Connection Establisher For CCv3
## What the program is about (Version Independant)
This was a program I made to help me practice simplifying my code and using single reponsibility principle. This is also a module that is apart of my Community Connect Repository that will be used for CCv3 to help establish a connection to a planned TCP (Possibly an SQL) server (https://github.com/NicolasCalafiore/Community-Connect). 

#### Created: Late 2022
