Objective: This project is planned to be used for my client application for Connected Community v3 (a long-running application I have been upgrading since 2018). It will be used at the startup of my Client application to handle the logic when trying to connect to the server. I am also trying to implement the use of more interfaces and objects along with an emphasize of the single role principle.

Functions:
 - Connect to set TCP server
 - Handle Reconnection
 - Handle Login and auto-login



Notes:
N/A

Date: Early 2023

This project was created around 2023 and will be maintained.



# Connection Establisher For CCv3
## What the program is about (Version Independant)
This was a program I made to help me practice simplifying my code and using single reponsibility principle. This is also a module that is apart of my Community Connect Repository that will be used for CCv3 to help establish a connection to a planned TCP server. 

#### Created: Late 2022
