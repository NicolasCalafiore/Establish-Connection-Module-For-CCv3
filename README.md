Objective: This project is planned to be used for my client application for Connected Community v3 (a long-running application I have been upgrading since 2018). It will be used at the startup of my Client application to handle the logic when trying to connect to the server. I am also trying to implement the use of more interfaces and objects along with an emphasize of the single role principle.

Functions:
 - Connect to set TCP server
 - Handle Reconnection
 - Handle Login and auto-login
